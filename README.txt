4. Payment Gateway Integration:
   - An online payment gateway will be integrated to facilitate the payment of registration fees.
   - Citizens will be able to make secure online payments using various payment methods, ensuring convenience and reducing the need for physical transactions.

5. Application Tracking and Status Updates:
   - Users will have access to a dashboard that allows them to track the progress of their birth certificate application.
   - The system will provide real-time status updates, notifying users of any changes or additional requirements.

6. Notifications and Alerts:
   - The system will send automated email or SMS notifications to users, informing them of successful registration, payment confirmations, and any additional actions required.

7. Data Security and Confidentiality:
   - Robust security measures will be implemented to protect user data and ensure confidentiality.
   - Encryption techniques will be employed to secure sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.
